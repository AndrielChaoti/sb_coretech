Crafted at the Engineer's Table, this item lets you upgrade the randomly generated weapons you find in the game world.

[b][u]Warp Core[/u][/b]
Warps you back to your ship from anywhere on a planet. (Does not stack, 5 minute cooldown)

[b][u]Blaststone[/u][/b]
[i]Just kidding, I lied. We didn't add blaststone[/i], but we did add a new way to craft it. 10 Cobblestone and 5 Lava at a wooden workbench will make 10 blaststone.
