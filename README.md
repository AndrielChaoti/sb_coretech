Gives you more things to do with core fragments!

# What this mod adds
## Core Forge

Crafted at the Engineer's Table, this item lets you upgrade the randomly generated weapons you find in the game world.

## Warp Core
Warps you back to your ship from anywhere on a planet. (Does not stack, 5 minute cooldown)

## Core Fragment Block
A sloped block that emits a nice warm core-fragment glow. It's not paintable, but craftable at the Wooden Workbench.

## Blaststone
_Just kidding, I lied. We didn't add blaststone_, but we did add a new way to craft it. 10 Cobblestone and 5 Lava at a wooden workbench will make 10 blaststone.
