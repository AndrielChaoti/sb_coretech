Warps you back to your ship from anywhere on a planet. (Does not stack, 5 minute cooldown)

## ![Icon](https://i.imgur.com/o2c5h5d.png) Stable Warp Core
Warps you back to your ship from __anywhere__. This version of the warp core also does not stack, but it is not consumed when used. The cooldown is 1 minute.

## ![Icon](https://i.imgur.com/JkBC7Lk.png) Core Fragment Block
A sloped block that emits a nice warm core-fragment glow. It's not paintable, but craftable at the Wooden Workbench.

## Blaststone
_Just kidding, I lied. We didn't add blaststone_, but we did add a new way to craft it. 10 Cobblestone and 5 Lava at a wooden workbench will make 10 blaststone.
