(Does not stack, 5 minute cooldown)\n\n[b][u]Core Fragment Block[/u][/b]\nThis wonderfully glowy block supports slopes! You can craft it at a Wooden Workbench.\n\n[b][u]Blaststone[/u][/b] \n[i]Just kidding, I lied. We didn't add blaststone[/i], but we did add a new way to craft it. 10 Cobblestone and 5 Lava at a wooden workbench will make 10 blaststone.\n\n[h1]Comaptibility[/h1]\nAs of right now, this mod does not have [b]any known[/b] comaptiblity issues, but if there are any, we will list them here.\n\n[h1]Bug Reports[/h1]\nIf you're having an issue because of my mod, whether it's compatibility or just a bug in the mod itself, please submit a bug report using [url=https://github.com/AndrielChaoti/sb_coretech/issues]GitHub Issues.[/url]\n\nThere is a Chucklefish Forums version of this mod here: https://community.playstarbound.com/resources/core-tech.5782/",
