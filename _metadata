(Does not stack, 5 minute cooldown)\n\n[b][u]Core Fragment Block[/u][/b]\nThis wonderfully glowy block supports slopes! You can craft it at a Wooden Workbench.\n\n[b][u]Blaststone[/u][/b] \n[i]Just kidding, I lied. We didn't add blaststone[/i], but we did add a new way to craft it. 10 Cobblestone and 5 Lava at a wooden workbench will make 10 blaststone.\n",
